 Program Name:  Tic Tac Game
 Program Description: This is a tic tac toe game. Its like a classic 
 game of tic tac toe, that keeps track of the score of the player, along
 with the ties. It also has a reset button to reset the scores Each game 
 has its own twist to show each programmers personality, along with their 
 programming skills. My display has a glitchy theme, that is because
 I am a fan of editing photos and videos, and adding these glitchy
 effects to them. Applied principles of object oriented programming 
 by using classes to encapsulate and abstract the board.
 This allowed us to change the internal representation of the board, 
 without changing rest of the code. The size and the difficulty were 
 also abstracted. Designed a user-friendly GUI using Java that anyone can use.
 Next step is to create an unbeatable AI.
